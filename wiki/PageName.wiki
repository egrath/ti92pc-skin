=How to use=

The skin is configured for usage with a V200 ROM. If you want to use it for a TI92/TI92+, you have to open it with the Skin Editor and change the Calculator type.

To use the skin, simply select it in the GUI. If you want to set the magnification to a fixed value, open up the tiemu.ini (located in the program folder) and modify the following line:

{{{
# View mode (normal/large/full/custom)
view_mode=custom (2,5)
}}}

In the above example a magnification of factor 2.5 is chosen.
